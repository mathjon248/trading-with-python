# tradingWithPython


This library contains code that is (re)usable in in daily tasks involving development of quantitative trading strategies.
It is used as my personal toobox as well as boiler-plate code for the [tradingWithPython](https://github.com/sjev/twp)
course.

Some parts of the library are [documented ](http://sjev.github.io/trading-with-python), for the missing parts the code itself should be readable enough.

**2021 update** I've open sourced the entire TWP course, enjoy! :tada:
